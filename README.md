# Density-dependence-Soay-sheep
The repository contains data and code to generate plots in the manuscript.

Data:
The data file is titled rand.params.csv. The .csv file contains 16 columns that correspond to our parameter set (intercropt, slope for size covariate, slope for population density covariate) for the four IPM functions. There are 10000 rows that correspond to different simulations from the covariance matrix.

Code:
Before running the code, please load the functions in the folder LRS and age-stage functions to load. 
Next, load the Soay sheep life history complete code.R
The code is annotated to note the sections that plot different figures.
